             Color, the color of diamonds is important and that is why it is one of the key values ​​in determining the value of a diamond.
            The color scale ranges from D-Z.
            Color D is a transparent and clear diamond and color Z which has a shade of yellow / brown / gray.
            Therefore, the lighter the diamond, the rarer the diamond and therefore the higher its price.
